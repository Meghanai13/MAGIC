Sphero SDK

Scratch: 
I created this app simulator whilst coding on Xcode to have a design reference for my final app. After designing and coding my scratch project, I also realized it served well as an an end goal for where I want my app to be to by the end of MAGIC. The simulator also includes many elements that you wonâ€™t find on the final app, like another shape option and a size picker.

 Using this simulator is very simple. You can choose the shape you want Sphero to draw, click on the color of light you want Sphero to be, increase or decrease the size of your shape with a stepper, and press start! Sphero will take all your preferences into account and draw your shape.
